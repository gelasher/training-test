# training-test

This is a test repository. It only has a few roles. But I changed it.

- demonstrate how to create a repository in Github
- practice with a commit
- later we'll see how to access the repository in RStudio

These are updates made from RStudio. Here we can:

- Add files to version control
- Commit changes
- Push commits to GitHub
<<<<<<< HEAD

- and this is a fourth thing we can do
